        "- **Understand the source**: Copilot is trained on public code repositories, which may include copyrighted material\n",
        "- **Review generated code**: Always examine suggestions before accepting them\n",

        "\n",
        "#### **Academic Integrity**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Follow institutional policies**: Check your school's guidelines on AI tool usage for assignments\n",
        "- **Transparent usage**: Acknowledge when you've used Copilot for coursework or projects\n",
        "- **Learning vs. automation**: Use Copilot to enhance learning, not replace understanding\n",

        "\n",
        "### Record Management\n",
        "-   **`add_patient(data)`**: Allows for the creation of new patient records, automatically generating a unique patient ID (e.g., `P001`). It also calculates and stores the BMI for each patient upon addition.\n",
        "-   **`get_patient(patient_id)`**: Enables retrieval of individual patient records using their unique ID.\n",
        "-   **`update_patient(patient_id, new_data)`**: Facilitates modifications to existing patient records. It intelligently updates specified fields and re-validates the entire record, including recalculating BMI if weight or height changes.\n",
        "-   **`get_all_patients()`**: Provides access to all stored patient records.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Validation\n",
        "-   **`_validate_patient_data(data)`**: An internal method that rigorously checks incoming patient data for completeness (e.g., all required fields are present), correct data types (e.g., name is a string, age is an integer), and valid values (e.g., positive age, valid gender, positive weight/height). It raises `ValueError` for any invalid input, ensuring data integrity throughout the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Statistical Analysis\n",
        "-   **`get_average_age()`**: Computes the average age of all patients in the system.\n",
        "-   **`get_average_bmi()`**: Calculates the average Body Mass Index across all patients.\n",
        "-   **`get_bmi_distribution()`**: Categorizes patients into standard BMI classifications (underweight, normal, overweight, obese) and provides a count for each category, offering insights into the patient population's health status.\n",
        "-   **`get_patients_with_condition(condition)`**: Filters and returns a list of patient IDs who share a specific medical condition.\n",

        "### Q&A\n",
        "\n",
        "The `PatientRecords` class provides a comprehensive system for managing patient records, addressing requirements across three core areas:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Record Management**: It offers `add_patient()`, `get_patient()`, `update_patient()`, and `get_all_patients()` methods. These methods facilitate the creation of new patient records with automatically generated unique IDs (e.g., \"P001\"), retrieval of individual records, modification of existing records (including automatic BMI recalculation upon weight/height changes), and access to the entire patient database.\n",
        "*   **Data Validation**: An internal `_validate_patient_data()` method rigorously enforces data integrity by checking for missing required fields, incorrect data types (e.g., non-string name, non-integer age), and invalid values (e.g., negative age, non-positive weight/height, invalid gender). Any invalid input raises a `ValueError`, preventing corrupt data from entering the system.\n",
        "*   **Statistical Analysis**: The class includes methods for basic statistical insights: `get_average_age()` and `get_average_bmi()` calculate mean values across all patients. `get_bmi_distribution()` categorizes patients into standard BMI groups (underweight, normal, overweight, obese) and counts patients in each. `get_patients_with_condition()` identifies patients based on specific medical conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Successful Record Management**: Four diverse patient records were successfully added, retrieved, and updated. For example, patient 'P001' (Sarah Connor) was initially added with a weight of 70kg and later updated to 68kg, successfully recalculating her BMI.\n",
        "*   **Robust Data Validation**: The class effectively validated inputs, correctly raising `ValueError` exceptions for invalid data, such as an attempt to add a patient with an age of -5, a height of 0, or an invalid gender like 'Alien'.\n",
        "*   **Accurate Statistical Analysis**:\n",
        "    *   The system accurately reported a total of 4 patients.\n",
        "    *   The calculated average age of all patients was 38.00 years.\n",
        "    *   The average BMI across all patients was 25.01.\n",
        "    *   The BMI distribution correctly categorized 3 patients as 'normal' and 1 patient as 'obese'.\n",
        "    *   Patients with specific conditions were correctly identified; for instance, 'P003' was identified with 'Diabetes' and 'P001' with 'Hypertension'.\n",
        "*   **Comprehensive Documentation**: The `PatientRecords` class and its methods are well-documented with docstrings, clearly explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The `PatientRecords` class provides a solid foundation for patient data management, demonstrating adherence to data integrity through validation and offering basic analytical capabilities.\n",
        "*   For future development, consider enhancing the statistical analysis methods to include standard deviation for age/BMI, trend analysis over time (if historical data is added), or more complex filtering options (e.g., patients with multiple specific conditions).\n"
